# Literature Review: 3D Diffusion Generation

## Abstract

This literature review provides a comprehensive overview of 3D diffusion generation, an emerging field that leverages diffusion models for creating three-dimensional content. As diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in 2D image generation, their extension to 3D content creation has opened new possibilities in computer graphics, virtual reality, and digital content creation. This review examines the theoretical foundations, key methodologies, applications, and future directions of 3D diffusion generation, analyzing both unconditional and conditional generation approaches.

## 1. Introduction

The field of 3D content generation has experienced a paradigm shift with the introduction of diffusion models. While traditional 3D generation methods often relied on specialized architectures and limited datasets, diffusion models offer a probabilistic framework that can capture complex data distributions and generate high-quality 3D content. This review synthesizes recent advances in 3D diffusion generation, examining how these models address the unique challenges of three-dimensional data while building upon the success of 2D diffusion models.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1 Diffusion Models Background

Diffusion models, originally proposed by Ho et al. (2020), are generative models based on a forward diffusion process that gradually adds noise to data and a reverse process that learns to denoise. The forward process transforms data from the original distribution q(x₀) to a simple noise distribution through a series of noise addition steps:

```
q(xₜ|xₜ₋₁) = N(xₜ; √(1-βₜ)xₜ₋₁, βₜI)
```

The reverse process learns to generate data by progressively denoising:

```
pθ(xₜ₋₁|xₜ) = N(xₜ₋₁; μθ(xₜ,t), σₜ²I)
```

### 2.2 Adaptation to 3D Data

Extending diffusion models to 3D data presents unique challenges:

1. **Representation Complexity**: 3D data can be represented in various forms (point clouds, meshes, voxels, implicit functions)
2. **Computational Complexity**: 3D operations are inherently more expensive than 2D
3. **Data Scarcity**: Limited availability of large-scale 3D datasets compared to 2D images
4. **Geometric Consistency**: Maintaining spatial coherence and geometric validity

## 3. 3D Representations in Diffusion Models

### 3.1 Explicit Representations

#### 3.1.1 Point Clouds
Point cloud diffusion has been pioneered by works like Point-Voxel Diffusion (Zhou et al., 2021) and LION (Vahdat et al., 2022). These methods treat point clouds as sets of 3D coordinates and apply diffusion directly in the point space.

- **Advantages**: Direct geometric representation, efficient for sparse data
- **Challenges**: Irregular structure, varying point densities

#### 3.1.2 Voxel Grids
Voxel-based diffusion models discretize 3D space into regular grids, enabling the use of 3D CNNs. However, they suffer from high memory requirements and limited resolution.

#### 3.1.3 Meshes
MeshDiffusion (Liu et al., 2023) introduces diffusion for mesh generation using deformable tetrahedral grids, addressing topology irregularities while maintaining surface quality.

### 3.2 Implicit Representations

#### 3.2.1 Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
Several works have explored diffusion in NeRF space:
- **DiffRF** (Müller et al., 2023): Generates explicit voxel-grid radiance fields
- **Triplane Diffusion** (Shue et al., 2023): Projects 3D scenes into 2D triplanes for efficient generation

#### 3.2.2 Signed Distance Functions (SDFs)
- **SDF-Diffusion** (Shim et al., 2023): Two-stage approach with low-resolution SDF generation followed by super-resolution
- **Diffusion-SDF** (Chou et al., 2023): Modulates SDFs into latent vectors for diffusion training

#### 3.2.3 3D Gaussian Splatting
Recent works have explored diffusion with 3D Gaussian representations, combining the efficiency of explicit representations with the flexibility of implicit methods.

## 4. Methodological Approaches

### 4.1 Unconditional 3D Generation

Unconditional generation focuses on learning the inherent distribution of 3D shapes without external guidance.
